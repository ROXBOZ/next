# üé¥ Poetic Tarot (AI-Generated Tarot Game)

This project started as a joke and turned into a playful experiment: a
tarot card game that blends tradition, humor, and technology. The goal
is simple---draw tarot cards, interpret them, and let the experience be
poetic, surreal, and fun.

It is **not** a faithful reproduction of traditional tarot, nor does it
pretend to teach the "true essence" of the practice. Instead, it's a
whimsical mix of AI, kitsch aesthetics, and game-like
interactions---something between an oracle, a toy, and a digital art
experiment.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Card Drawing & Shuffle:** Cards are drawn and shuffled completely
  at random, mimicking the unpredictability of real tarot.\
- **Guidebook Replacement:** Instead of the classic little booklet
  included in tarot decks, the app provides a built-in guide with
  explanations depending on the card, its position
  (past/present/future), and orientation (upright/reversed). This
  guide is **not AI-generated**, but crafted to help users make their
  own interpretations.\
- **AI Interpretations (via OpenAI):** Users can also request a
  generated interpretation powered by ChatGPT. For now, the prompts
  need refining---the texts are functional but not always poetic
  enough.\
- **Playful Interactions:**
  - Sound effects for shuffling, selecting, and placing cards.\
  - Hidden surprises like a laugh when clicking the logo.\
  - A quirky "nonsense detector" that responds with humorous error
    messages if the user types gibberish instead of a real
    question.\
- **Accessibility & Atmosphere:** Balances a kitschy tarot vibe with
  modern web accessibility standards. Fully responsive for different
  devices.\
- **Poetic Ambitions:** Future plans include writing original poetic
  card descriptions and creating hand-drawn illustrations for each
  card.

## üé® Philosophy

This project isn't about taking tarot too seriously---it's about
**having fun, experimenting, and exploring design and UX questions in a
creative way**.\
It's both a playground for technology (AI, UI/UX, sound design) and an
artistic experiment.
